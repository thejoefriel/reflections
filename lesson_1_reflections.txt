Comparing two different files = diff -u <file1> <file2>


How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Through + - symbols, shows you what has been removed clearly assigned
    to each file

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It means you can quickly spot errors by seeing what has been changed since
    it was last working correctly

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Cons:
      - you may forget to do it for ages meaning more changes have been made

    Pros:
      - you don't have loads of versions to track back through which would be
      just as time consuming when needing to make revisions
      - Google docs history isn't available offline
      Google docs can't use any editor

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In Git you're most likely working on multiple files for one website/program
    whereas in Google Docs each file is its own entity
    A multi-file commit lets you commit the changes of the file at the same time 
    so you can then more easily see what changes have been made 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log lets you see the history of commits within the repo
    Git diff lets you compare two commits (so an old and a new) to see what has
    been deleted and added between the git commit IDs

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because you have a safety net that you can quickly resort to if it goes
    wrong. To do this use git log and then git checkout with the ID of the 
    commit you want to revert to

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Not sure yet!
