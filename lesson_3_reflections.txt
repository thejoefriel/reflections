When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If you want to be able to contribute via different computers to work on the project and/or if you have other people wanting to contribute to the project. 



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You may be working on something separate to other people contributing on the same project and don't want any merging to happen at this stage. 
People can contribute to your remote so there may be errors or changes that you don't want. 
It's easier to clearly see what is local to your computer and what is online.
